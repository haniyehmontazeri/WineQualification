**Objective:** 
The goal of this project is to design, implement, and evaluate a deep learning architecture for classifying wine quality 
based on physicochemical properties of red and white wine samples. The project will provide hands-on experience in 
designing and applying deep neural network models, with a focus on solving a real-world multi-class classification 
problem. 

**Dataset:** 
The dataset for this project is available online at the UCI Machine Learning Repository: Wine Quality Dataset. It 
contains physicochemical properties (input features) of red and white wines from the Vinho Verde region of Portugal, 
as well as quality ratings (output labels). The classification task is to predict the wine quality based on these features. 
Red Wine Dataset: Contains data for red wine samples, including features like acidity, sugar levels, and alcohol 
content. 

White Wine Dataset: Contains data for white wine samples with similar features.

**Requirements:** 
• You should develop and train separate models for the red and white wine datasets. 

• You may use any programming language or toolbox of your choice, with Python, MATLAB, or Octave being 
strongly recommended.

• Techniques like data normalization, feature selection, and dropout can be applied to improve model 
performance. You are encouraged to experiment with different architectures, optimizers (e.g., SGD, Adam), and 
learning rates to achieve better results.

• Submit the project as a document with the code attached or linked. Ensure that the report includes well
commented code snippets or relevant explanations for the key parts of the implementation.

**this project include a structured as follows:**

o Introduction: Briefly introduce the wine classification problem and its significance in wine production. 
Describe the red and white wine datasets, including a summary of their structure and the quality ratings 
(output variable). 

o Model Design: Provide an overview of the neural network architecture you designed. Justify your choice of 
architecture, layers, activation functions, and any other key components. Discuss any pre-processing steps 
applied to the data, such as normalization or feature selection.

o Implementation: Explain the programming environment (e.g., language, libraries, and tools) you used for 
implementation. Provide details on how you divided the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. If 
using any pre-written code, ensure you properly cite its source and explain the algorithm. 

o Training Process: Describe the training process, including the optimizer, learning rate, batch size, and the 
number of epochs. Mention any challenges you faced during training (e.g., overfitting) and how you 
addressed them. 

o Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of your models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, 
recall, and F1-score. Compare the performance of the models for red and white wine. Include visualizations of 
the loss and accuracy over epochs and confusion matrix results for both models. 

o Conclusion: Summarize your findings and the effectiveness of your models for red and white wine quality 
prediction. Suggest potential improvements or alternative approaches for better performance.
